# Phoneme synthesis and maze navigation based on DN-2
We used Developmental Network-2 (DN-2) to experiment two sequential tasks of different modalities.  These two experiments are based on the same DN-2 pacakge.

**The learn-to-recognize-through-synthesis experiment**  
The learn-to-recognize-through-synthesis experiment trains DN-2 to syntesize the phonemes it heard with self-supervision and recognize the phoneme types with temporally sparse labels.  
Please read `READ_ME_Phoneme.pdf` to see the settings and how to run it.

**The simulated maze navigation experiment**  
The maze navigation experiment trains DN-2 to learn navigation skills, chain these skills and choose an optimal route to the destination in a simulated maze environment.  
Please read `READ_ME_Maze.pdf` to see the settings and how to run it.
